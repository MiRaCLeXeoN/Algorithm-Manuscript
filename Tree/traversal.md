Traversal result cannot reflect the original tree structure. Two different trees may derive the same traversal result. We can conclude that any traversal-based solution cannot be used for determining tree structure!

# Morris Traversal

Morris traversal has time complexity $O(n)$ (But nodes may be visited more than once), and space complexity $O(1)$.

If uses the leaf nodes' children pointer.
