## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
private:
    void getNext(int *next, string& s) {
        int j = -1;
        next[0] = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
            while (j >= 0 && s[i] != s[j + 1]) {
                j = next[j];
            }
            if (s[i] == s[j + 1]) {
                j++;
            }
            next[i] = j;
        }
    }
public:
    bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s) {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return false;
        }
        int *next = new int[s.size()];
        this->getNext(next, s);
        int len = s.size();
        bool res = false;
        // If there is an overlapping part of the prefix and suffix,
        // the string must be composed of repeated units. The condition can 
        // be incoporated into the len%(len - pre_or_suf_len)
        if (next[len - 1] != -1 && len % (len - (next[len - 1] + 1)) == 0) {
            res = true;
        }
        delete[] next;
        return res;
    }
};

The Chinese leetcode provides a very comprehensive [solution](https://leetcode.cn/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/solutions/386481/zhong-fu-de-zi-zi-fu-chuan-by-leetcode-solution/).

This solution is the same as the leetcode-master's solution. Check the link below.

The hardest part of this solution is the `if` condition `if (next[len - 1] != -1 && len % (len - (next[len - 1] + 1)) == 0)`. Why so? It's not hard to conclude that when a string is composed of repeated substring pattern, it meets this. But how is the reverse?

Let's draw a diagram to explain it:

```
aacbd aacbd aacbd aacbd
|-a--|----b------|
     |----b------|-a--|
```

The prefix is `a+b`, and the suffix is `b+a`. If `(a + b) * 2 < len`, it must not be a repeated string. So we only discuss the situation where `(a+b)*2>=len`. If `len % a == 0`, we know that `len = n*a`, then we have `b = (n-2)*a`. See the diagram in the [leetcode master](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master/blob/master/problems/0459.%E9%87%8D%E5%A4%8D%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%90%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%A6%E4%B8%B2.md). It will explain you why when `b` is a multiple of `a`, the string must be a repeated string.

On the other hand, the following conditioning if incorrect because is cannot properly handle all situations:

```C++
if ((next[len - 1] + 1) * 2 >= len) {
    res = true;
}
```

Take `aabaaba` for example. The overlapping part is only `a`, and it meets the `if` condition. Seeing examples like this, we have be careful that only through rigorous mathematical reasoning can we have a solid solution. Guessing and instincts are not working all the time.
