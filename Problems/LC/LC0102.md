# Leetcode 0102 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

# Submissions

## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void levelTraversal(TreeNode* cur, vector<vector<int>>& res, int depth) {
        if (cur == nullptr) return;
        if (res.size() == depth) {
            // We reach a new level. Create a new vector
            res.push_back(vector<int>());
        }

        res[depth].push_back(cur->val);
        levelTraversal(cur->left, res, depth + 1);
        levelTraversal(cur->right, res, depth + 1);
    }

    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        levelTraversal(root, res, 0);
        return res;
    }
};
```

This is a recursive solution.

I was deeply influenced by the `queue` solution and cannot understand how to implement a recursive solution at the beginning. However, as long as I can remember that **recursive** is in nature a methodology about splitting giant problems into many sub-problems with same structure, it's not hard to find that **level** is the critical feature that helps to divide the problem.

Why this solution works? There is one more key factor: the returned value is of type of `vector<vector<int>>`. You can process different levels inside left sub-tree and then counterparts in the right sub-tree, and push the values into appropriate places. If the problem force that you return a vector and you cannot derive it from nested vectors, this recursive solution cannot serve its purpose. Because when you have finished the left subtree, you cannot insert the elements in the right subtree into right indices of the vector.

## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        queue<TreeNode*> que;
        TreeNode* cur;
        if (root == nullptr) return res;
        que.push(root);
        while (!que.empty()) {
            // One iteration handles one level.
            // Freeze size here since it will change during the process
            int levelSize = que.size();
            vector<int> levelRes;
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                cur = que.front();
                que.pop();
                if (cur->left) que.push(cur->left);
                if (cur->right) que.push(cur->right);
                levelRes.push_back(cur->val);
            }
            res.push_back(levelRes);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

`queue` solution. Very simple and straightforward.
