## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, map<string, int>> airlines;
    vector<string> curPath;
    int numTickets;
    bool dfs() {
        if (curPath.size() == numTickets + 1) {
            return true;
        }

        string lastPot = curPath.back();
        for (pair<const string, int> &airline : airlines[lastPot]) {
            // map is ordered, so that we start from minimal lexical string
            if (airline.second > 0) {  // tickets available
                airline.second--;
                curPath.push_back(airline.first);
                if (dfs()) {
                    return true;  // Target itinerary is found, stop searching
                }
                curPath.pop_back();
                airline.second++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        airlines.clear();
        curPath.clear();
        for (auto &ticket : tickets) {
            airlines[ticket[0]][ticket[1]]++;
        }
        numTickets = tickets.size();
        curPath.push_back("JFK");
        dfs();
        return curPath;
    }
};
```

Tips:

1. Why `unordered_map<string, map<string, int>>`? 
   1. The data structure of this problem is in nature a graph. Any data structure compatible with graph is absolutely ok. This is just one of the option.
   2. We choose `unordered_map` because we want to store the mapping nature of `tickets`, i.e., from one place to another. 
   3. Why `map`? First, one departure place may have different destinations of different tickets, so we need a container. Second, we want to destinations ordered to help us search the string with minimal lexical order, and `map` is ordered in nature.
   4. Why `int`? When doing dfs, we need to mark a ticket used to avoid any unexpected reuse. If we use structure like `set`, we have to insert and delete elements, which may invalidate the iterator. Therefore, we can use a integer as a mark to indicate whether this ticket has been used. Wonderful!
2. DFS recursive functions absolutely could have return value. Don't set yourself in stereotype!
