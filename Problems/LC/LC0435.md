# Leetcode 0435 Non-overlapping Intervals

# Submissions

## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    static bool cmp(vector<int>& va, vector<int>& vb) {
        if (va[0] == vb[0]) return va[1] < vb[1];
        return va[0] < vb[0];
    }
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // 1. sort intervals by start positions
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), cmp);
        // 2. search group by group
        int num_non_overlapping = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size();) {
            int backBound = intervals[i][1];
            int idx = i + 1;
            while (idx < intervals.size() && intervals[idx][0] <= backBound) {
                backBound = min(backBound, intervals[idx][1]);
                idx++;
            }
            // We find a non-overlapping interval
            num_non_overlapping++;
            i = idx;
        }
        return intervals.size() - num_non_overlapping;
    }
};
```

Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$.

Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

This method is adapted from LC0452. LC0452 finds the number of non-overlapping intervals by aggregating overlapped intervals along the way. Once we subtract the number of non-overlapping intervals from the total count, we get the result.

## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    static bool cmp(vector<int>& va, vector<int>& vb) {
        if (va[0] == vb[0]) return va[1] < vb[1];
        return va[0] < vb[0];
    }
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // 1. sort intervals by start positions
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), cmp);
        // 2. search group by group
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); ) {
            int backBound = intervals[i][1];
            int idx = i + 1;
            while (idx < intervals.size() && intervals[idx][0] < backBound) {
                backBound = min(backBound, intervals[idx][1]);
                ret++;
                idx++;
            }
            i = idx;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```

Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$. (quick sort)

Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

This version is modified from V1. Instead of counting non-overlapping intervals, we directly get the number of intervals should be removed.

It's really hard to prove why this method works and is the optimal one. For example, when several intervals overlap, is there any difference between removing different intervals? I don't know.

This is where greedy strategy particularly sucks, usually we cannot derive a rigorous mathematical proof to support our implementation. We have to simulate and try.
