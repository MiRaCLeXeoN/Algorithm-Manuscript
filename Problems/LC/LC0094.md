## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void traversal(TreeNode* cur, vector<int>& vec) {
        if (cur == NULL) return;
        traversal(cur->left, vec);
        vec.push_back(cur->val);
        traversal(cur->right, vec);
    }

    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> vec;
        traversal(root, vec);
        return vec;
    }
};
```

Recursive manner.


## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> vec;
        stack<TreeNode*> st;  // stack is used for remembering path
        TreeNode* cur = root;  // cur is used for traversal
        while (cur != NULL || !st.empty()) {
            // cur != NULL is very important, since when we move from left to right, the stack 
            // may become empty during the transition

            // We do not have `cur=st.top()` here. Therefore `cur` is no longer bound to `st`.
            if (cur != NULL) {
                st.push(cur);
                cur = cur->left;
            } else {
                cur = st.top();
                st.pop();
                vec.push_back(cur->val);
                cur = cur->right;
            }
        }
        return vec;
    }
};
```

The iteration-based solution of inorder traversal is different from preorder traversal, since the two steps: visiting nodes and pushing elements into the vector, are not processed at the same time. In the preorder traversal, when you visit the root of the subtree, you will process it immediately. However, in the inorder and postorder traversal, these two steps are separated. This change is shown in the code by unbinding `cur` and `st.top()`.

The pointer `cur` is used for visiting nodes, while stack is used for remembering the path. When we have done the left subtree and move to the right part, the stack become empty for a short time, because the next target in `cur` (`cur` is the root of the right subtree at this time). So we cannot simply use `!st.empty()` as exit condition of the loop and must add `cur != NULL`.

## C++ V3

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        stack<TreeNode*> st;
        vector<int> res;
        TreeNode* cur;
        if (root != nullptr) st.push(root);
        while (!st.empty()) {
            cur = st.top();
            if (cur != nullptr) {
                st.pop();
                if (cur->right) st.push(cur->right);
                st.push(cur);
                st.push(nullptr);
                if (cur->left) st.push(cur->left);
            } else {
                // pop is only done when we encounter null
                st.pop();
                cur = st.top();
                st.pop();
                res.push_back(cur->val);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

This solution is a modified version from V2 with unified structure. 

`nullptr` is used to mark visited nodes. With these marks, we can distinguish between visited and unvisited nodes, therefore determine whether we need to pop elements out.

In V2, we cannot push `left` and `right` we we process root, because we cannot determine whether we should push a node's child when we encounter it again in the stack. A mark, whether a bit or a variable, can solve this problem.
