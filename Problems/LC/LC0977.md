## C++ V1

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<vector>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (auto i = nums.begin(); i != nums.end(); i++) {
            *i = pow(*i, 2);
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        return nums;
    }
};

void readin(vector<int>& nums){
    int a = 0;
    while (!cin.eof()) {
        cin >> a;
        nums.push_back(a);
    }

    for (auto num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    } 
}

int main(){
    vector<int> nums = {};
    readin(nums);
    Solution s;
    s.sortedSquares(nums);

    cout << endl;
    for (auto num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The simplest version. Remember that `sort` is in-place transformation.


## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> result(nums.size());
        int head = 0, tail = nums.size() - 1;
        int head_num, tail_num;
        for (int i = result.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            head_num = nums[head] * nums[head];
            tail_num = nums[tail] * nums[tail];
            if (head_num > tail_num) {
                result[i] = head_num;
                head++;
            }
            else {
                result[i] = tail_num;
                tail--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

Since the array is non-decreasingly ordered, we can infer that the biggest number we haven't process yet must lie at the either end of the array. Double pointers would help to solve this problem.

<font color=red>Be careful that you should calculate head_num and tail_num at the beginning of each iteration, since there may be situations where ther is only 1 element in the array. You have to take robustness under special conditions into your consideration.</font>

Double pointer essentially is a method to iterate, but you are concurrently searching through two paths. If there are 3 or even more possible paths, certainly that you may develop a program using "triple pointers". That is the eesence and the fundamental mechanism of "double pointers".
