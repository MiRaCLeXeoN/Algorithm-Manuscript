                    cur = cur->left;
                }
                cur->left = root->left;

                return tmp;
            }
        }
        if (root->val < key) root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);

```

Recursive solution.

When you find the target node, there are 4 conditions in total:

1. Left and right are both `nullptr`, you are safely delete the current node.
2. Left is empty and right is not, replace the current node with right subtree.
3. Right is empty and left is not, replace the current node with left subtree.
4. Left and right are both non-empty, we should move left subtree to the minimal node in right subtree's left child, and finally return right subtree.

There are many methods to adjust the BST in condition 4. This implementation is just one of them.

Besides this, you can replace the current node with the minimal node in right subtree, or the maximal node in the left subtree. Keep doing this until `key` node is ultimate replaced with `nullptr`, i.e. deleted.

Notice that `minimal node in right subtree != left most leaf node in right subtree`. When `cur->right->left == nullptr`, the minimal node in the right sub tree is `cur->right`, which may not be a leaf node.

## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteOneNode(TreeNode *cur) {
        TreeNode* ret;
        if (!cur->left && !cur->right) {
            delete cur;
            ret = nullptr;
        } else if (!cur->right) {
            ret = cur->left;
            delete cur;
        } else {
            TreeNode* it = cur->right;
            ret = cur->right;
            // Find minimal node in the right subtree
            while (it->left) {
                it = it->left;
            }
            it->left = cur->left;
            delete cur;
        }
        return ret;
    }
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        TreeNode *cur = root, *pre = nullptr;
        while (cur) {
            if (cur->val == key) break;  // Target found
            pre = cur;
            if (cur->val < key) cur = cur->right;
            else cur = cur->left;
        }
        if (!cur) {  // key is not found
            return root;
        }

        if (!pre) {
            // only root node in the tree
            return deleteOneNode(cur);
        } else if (pre->left && pre->left == cur) {
            pre->left = deleteOneNode(cur);
        } else {
            pre->right = deleteOneNode(cur);
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

Iterative solution.

`deleteOneNode` can be reused.
