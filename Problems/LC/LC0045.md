## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) return 0;
        int ret = 0;
        int stepDistance = 0;  // Step distance
        int maxReach = 0;  // The max reachable distance
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() && i <= maxReach; i++) {
            maxReach = max(maxReach, i + nums[i]);
            if (i == stepDistance) {
                // We reach the max length at this step
                ret++;
                stepDistance = maxReach;
                if (maxReach >= nums.size() - 1) break;
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```

Time complexity: $O(n)$.

The most critical part is when to increment `ret`. When should we jump another step? At each step, we have a local furthest reachable distance, which means the maximum distance we can reach with current `ret` steps. We search the positions one by one forward until this step-wise limit. If we can reach the end, we've find the answer. If we cannot, we should increment one more step, until we reach the destination.

This is a greedy solution, since we use the maximum reachable distance at each step. (But this is not very much similar to those traditional greedy solutions, since we don't need local optimum to reach the overall optimum.)
