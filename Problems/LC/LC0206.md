# Leetcode 0206 Reverse Linked List

# Submissions

## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            return ;
        }
        ListNode* cur = head, * pre = head, * curNext = cur->next;
        head->next = nullptr;
        while (curNext != nullptr) {
            cur = curNext;
            curNext = curNext->next;
            cur->next = pre;
            pre = cur;
        }

        return cur;
    }
};
```

You need at least 3 temporary variables to handle this.



## C++ V2

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* cur = head, * pre = nullptr, * curNext;
        while (cur) {
            curNext = cur->next;
            cur->next = pre;
            pre = cur;
            cur = curNext;
        }
        return pre;
    }
};
```

This version unifies all conditions in the main loop. This is very tricky, and demands a clear understanding and analysis of the situations. `cur` is always the current node you are processing, `pre` is the previous node you have processed. At the beginning, it's very straight to initialize `cur` as head, and `pre` as `NULL`. 

The conditioning and return value are also very important.
