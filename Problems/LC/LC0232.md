# Leetcode 0232 Implement Queue using Stacks

# Submissions

## C++ V1

```C++
class MyQueue {
private:
    stack<int> stIn;
    stack<int> stOut;
    int count;
    void _transferElements() {
        while (!stIn.empty()) {
            stOut.push(stIn.top());
            stIn.pop();
        }
    }

public:
    MyQueue(): count(0) { }

    void push(int x) {
        stIn.push(x);
        count++;
    }
    
    // ? What if the queue is empty?
    int pop() {
        if (stOut.empty()) {
            this->_transferElements();
        }
        if (!stOut.empty()) {
            int tmp = stOut.top();
            stOut.pop();
            count--;
            return tmp;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    int peek() {
        if (stOut.empty()) {
            this->_transferElements();
        }
        return stOut.top();
    }
    
    bool empty() {
        return count == 0;    
    }
};
```

Queue is a FIFO data structure, while the stack is its counterpart of LIFO. You can image that stacks reverse the order of the sequence. It's natural to conclude that two stacks will reverse the reversed order, which reverts to the original order. Therefore, we can use two stacks to imitate the behaviours of queues.

There is another point worht to note: try to reuse codes as much as possible. If you have two functions sharing parts of same codes, such as peek() and pop(), please don't hesitate to extract it and make it a separate function. REUSE IS CRITICAL!
