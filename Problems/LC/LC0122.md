# Leetcode 0122 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

# Submissions

## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] - prices[i - 1] > 0) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

The profit in a time range can be decomposed into profits of individual days. For example, `prices[3] - prices[0] = (p[3] - p[2]) + (p[2] - p[1]) + (p[1] - p[0])`. Thus, we can focus on price difference of each day between its previous day.

This solution is also DP in nature. `profit[i] = profit[i-1] + max(p[i] - p[i-1], 0)`.
