## C++ V1

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            auto partnerIdx = map.find(target - nums[i]);
            if (partnerIdx != map.end()) {  // exists
                return vector<int>({partnerIdx->second, i});
                //return {partnerIdx->second, i};
            }
            // not found, insert current number and index into map
            map.insert(pair<int, int>(nums[i], i));
        }
        return vector<int>({});
        // return {}
    }
};
```

Array is not applicable if the target is tool large, since it requires at least `target/2` slots to store the naive hash table. On the other hand, `set` data structure is not suitable to this situation, for the sake of its simple element form. We need to store the number itself and its index at the same time, a condition where `map` comes very handy.

Remember that elements of a map are pairs, so you have to insert or reference in the way you do with a pair, like `partnerIdx->second`. Furthermore, even though the function requires a vector of integers as return value, you can simply return an array in the form of `{a, b}`, which is automatically converted into a vector to be returned.
